  <section class="odd">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Alan Watts was known for his witty views on religions,
      especially of Eastern descent. He had a very
      particular way of explaining "dodgy" topics that
      most would not delve into. He continually awed
      crowds with his jokes and light-heated nature.He
      had many quotes which were influential during
      the self-help movement as well as the spirituality
      movement which was re-occuring during his time.

    <h2>Interesting Theories</h2>
    <p>Alan's way of thinking was one that has never quite
      been matched. He knew how to take any situation
      and make it understandable. Among his interesting
      theories, he continually stated that the world
      is opposites. He took the notion that everything
      is dependent on its opposites in order to exist.
      In other words, we cannot know evil unless we
      had good to compare it to. This is one of his
      most intersting theories. He also had a never
      ending list of stories about zen masters and
      way that they would awaken their students. His
      stories and way of speaking will live on for
      generations.</p>
